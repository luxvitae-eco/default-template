    subtitle: Built on Wisdom and Modern Responsibility
    text: >
      We build homes with local stone, reclaimed wood, guided by ancestral knowledge and modern sustainable technologies. Our architecture nurtures ecosystems, supports community, and endures through honest materials and thoughtful design. We create high-performance homes rooted in place, crafted for well-being, and shared with future generations.
      

      **Founding Philosophy**  

      This vision is guided by Nuno Luciano, Founder and Architectural
      Visionary, who ensures every design, partnership, and platform feature
      remains rooted in authentic sustainability.
