### Design Philosophy: Rooted in Place

Designed for a young family seeking connection and resilience, The Family Courtyard sits on a sunny Mediterranean hillside, offering expansive views of the Atlantic Ocean. The architecture is deeply integrated with the local landscape, balancing modern environmental response with organic heritage.

The dwelling covers 160 square meters, positioned strategically on its generous plot to maximize privacy and light. The central design element is the sheltered courtyard, which provides a safe, contained space for children to play and for the family to gather with friends and extended family.

### Ethical Practice & Materials

The house reflects a commitment to ethical practice through its material selection and passive design features:

- **Local Sourcing** : Constructed using traditional local stone and wood, minimizing the environmental impact of transport and supporting regional economies.

- **Passive Performance** : Optimized insulation and carefully positioned windows capture sunlight throughout the day while mature Mediterranean pine trees provide natural wind protection.

### Regenerative Features

The project extends beyond basic efficiency to actively regenerate the surrounding environment:

- **Edible Landscape** : The surrounding garden features a small orchard of citrus and kiwi trees, alongside a vegetable square dedicated to growing tomatoes, salads, and herbs, promoting local food security and well-being.

- **High-Performance Systems** : Modern technology provides long-term value via high-performant solar panels for renewable energy and a comprehensive rainwater recycling system for sustainable water management.

### Result

The Family Courtyard is a home built for the Art of Living, a high-performance, regenerative space where the family can thrive, supported by ethical construction and integrated natural systems.
