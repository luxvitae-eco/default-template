_Lux Vitae Eco - Architecture Mediterranean Sanctuary_

### Project Overview

| Detail | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Location | Border of Andalusia and Algarve (Mediterranean coast) |
| Client | Retired couple of two, prioritizing long-term accessibility and community. |
| Size | Single-story dwellings with a flexible guest/studio unit. |
| Architectural Style | Accessible, single-level design integrating local materials and **timeless methods**. |
| Core Values | Proximity, Well-being, Accessible Aging, Climate-Responsive Design. |


### Design Philosophy: Proximity and Independence

While designed for a retired couple, The Sanctuary challenges the idea of conventional aging-in-place, which often leads to isolation. By concentrating on proximity and community, the project creates a unique, supportive environment.

The homes form a cohesive and supportive Accessible Village. Since all units are single-story and linked by level, stair-free pathways, the design encourages residents to easily visit and gather, fostering a strong sense of community.

The homes are designed for long-term comfort and safety. The single-level layout ensures maximum comfort and safety for the couple, regardless of their future physical condition, solidifying the home as a truly valuable and long-term asset.

### Ethical Practice & Materials

The site was specifically chosen for its natural defenses. It features Climate-Responsive Siting where an adjacent hillside protects the homes from high winds. Crucially, the short distance a small stream (or brook) that connects to a nearby natural river creates a naturally refreshing micro-climate, significantly reducing summer heat.

Our commitment to Local Sourcing is tied directly to performance. The homes are constructed using regional materials and ancient methods, such as thick walls and appropriate shading, which work together to optimize thermal performance. This approach not only ensures a comfortable climate but also significantly reduces the environmental impact associated with material transport.

### Regenerative Features

A key Regenerative Feature is the inclusion of a highly Flexible Space. This versatile extra room or studio can effortlessly function as a home office, dedicated guest accommodation, or a dedicated space for an in-home carer, significantly extending the home's utility and contributing to the social resilience of the residents

> This design incorporates a powerful element of Cross-Generational Appeal. While initially conceived for aging residents, the single-story layout makes it equally attractive as a first-choice home for young families seeking low-maintenance, accessible living. 

This design choice demonstrates that a simple, open-plan, single-story layout is proof that design which prioritizes comfort and accessibility is not restrictive, but rather universally beneficial across all generations.

### Results

The Sanctuary is an exemplar of **accessible, community-focused architecture**. It delivers independent, long-term well-being for its residents within a beautiful, naturally climate-controlled environment, proving that ethical design is both humane and future-proof.
